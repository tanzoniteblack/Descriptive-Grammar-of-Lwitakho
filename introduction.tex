\chapter{Introduction}
This is a grammar made as a final project for the field methods of linguistics course and Indiana University.  The course consisted of original research conducted by students, and directed by Professor Robert Botne.  The research was conducted by working with a native speaker of the Lwitaxo language in class and in private interview sessions.
